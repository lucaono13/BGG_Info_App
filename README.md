# BGG Info App
App that will take board game info from Board Game Geek and will create a .csv file from it.

Created using Python and Kivy


**Features**
* Search Board Game Geek XMLAPI2 for results that fit the search
* Read results from search [WIP] - Working on added Recycle View instead of scroll view
  - Recycle view is giving errors: search function does return results, put doesn't output to a recycle view correctly yet.
* Selected board games to add to csv file [WIP]
* Import .csv file and add/remove board games [WIP]
* See rows on database like results [WIP]
* More features...

This is a very barebones ReadMe file. As I get more done and know what more I should write, I will update readme as much as possible.
